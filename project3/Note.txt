-----Update---- 

After reading the project's description, we thougth it would be good to start with Black-Scholes method to calculate delta & gamma and compare it to the method already implemented.

We intend to change greeks calculation using the new method and compare the values.
Then, we will compare the time taken by the old method and the new one.
